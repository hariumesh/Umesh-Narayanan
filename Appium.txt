		DesiredCapabilities cap = new DesiredCapabilities (); 
		cap.setCapability("platformName", "Android");
		cap.setCapability("deviceName", "S8WCV8UWGUJ7MVNF");//This is the device which already connected to the machine.
		cap.setCapability("appPackage", "com.pacakagename.example"); //This and below activity details will be availbale with the Developer
		cap.setCapability("appActivity", "com.packagename.example.activityname");// Need to specify the common Main activity here.
		
		// This would send the desired capability specified for the above device to the Appium server
		RemoteWebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://0.0.0.0:4723/wd/hub/"), cap);
